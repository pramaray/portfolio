    inspired by the 1969 novel of the same name by Italian American author Mario Puzo.

<h3>Before</h3>
<h4>Genre : Romance</h4>
<p>
    The Before Trilogy consists of three American romance films directed by Richard Linklater, 
    and starring Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy.Set and filmed in nine year intervals, the films 
    chronicle the romantic relationship between Jesse (Hawke) and CÃ©line (Delpy) at three periods 
    of their lives.The films are considered minimal, consisting mostly of monologues and casual 
    conversation with extended dialogue between the characters. Contrasting ideas and perspectives
     on life and love are detailed, with the series referencing time, self-discovery, age, loss, and 
     parentage; it is considered an exploration of postmodern romance.

<h3>The Hangover</h3>
<h4>Genre : Comedy</h4>
<p>
    The Hangover is a series of American comedy films created by Jon Lucas and Scott Moore, and directed 
    by Todd Phillips. All three films follow the misadventures of a quartet of friends (also known as "the Wolfpack") 
    who go on their road trip to attend a bachelor party. While all of the films find three of the four men on a mission
    to find their missing friend, the first two films focus on the events after the nights of debauchery before a party, 
    respectively in Las Vegas and Bangkok, whereas the third and final film involves a road trip and a kidnapping in lieu 
    of a bachelor party. Each film in the series focuses on how the friends deal with the aftermath of their antics, while
    they are being humiliated and occasionally physically beaten up at every turn.
