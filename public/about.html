<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  Hello! I'm Prama Ray, currently a second-year student at 
  Jadavpur University, pursuing a Bachelor's in Information 
  Technology. I'm passionate about technology, and I find immense 
  satisfaction in both the technical and creative sides of the 
  field. With a versatile skill set across various languages and 
  tools, including C++, C, Java, Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, 
  and SQL, I’m equipped to work on projects that range from 
  backend logic to responsive and engaging front-end designs.
</p>

<p>
  Graphic design has been a natural passion of mine, allowing me to
  express creativity and attention to detail. I enjoy experimenting 
  with colors, typography, and layouts to create designs that are
  not only visually appealing but also meaningful. From digital
  art and logos to designing user interfaces, I thrive on projects 
  that demand both aesthetic sense and precision. For me, design isn’t 
  just about how something looks; it’s about how it functions and feels, 
  ensuring a user-friendly and memorable experience.
</p>

<p>
  In coding, I love the challenge of problem-solving—whether it's
  crafting an efficient algorithm, optimizing databases, or 
  designing a seamless user experience. Each new project is an 
  opportunity to learn, refine my skills, and push boundaries, 
  and I’m particularly drawn to combining design thinking with 
  technical skills to build solutions that are both powerful and 
  elegant.
</p>

<p>
  Looking forward, I aim to merge my technical expertise and 
  passion for design into a career that allows me to contribute 
  to innovative projects that make technology accessible, 
  enjoyable, and impactful. I’m intrigued by areas like full-stack 
  development, UI/UX design, and even emerging fields like AI, 
  where I see a future for merging data and design for practical 
  and creative solutions.
</p>

<p>
  Outside academics and projects, I’m always keen on exploring new 
  design tools, keeping up with tech trends, and learning from others 
  in the industry. Reading, traveling, and exploring creative 
  outlets outside tech give me fresh perspectives and inspiration. 
  I’m excited about connecting with like-minded individuals, gaining 
  insights, and expanding my horizons as I continue on this journey.
